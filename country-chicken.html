          <p>Implant training is not a misnomer. It explains the true motive behind a quality IPT. An “Inplant” training “Implants” in the students, the talent to see things in industry perspective. It also provides an opportunity to see and use tools that you, as a student, has never even dreamed of using. Implant training improves the students practical ability to approach and solve problems in his/her workplace. Whatever steps you take now, will yield results later, when you step into your core company. You will observe that your way of obtaining solutions to problem is more matured and experienced than your colleagues. The first 2 years in your job decides your career growth for the rest of your work life. To stay ahead of others in this aspect you should equip yourselves with stuffs that no one has. IPT, again, is the key to it. Chennai is the commercial heart of Tamilnadu and is core area for industrial success and educational achievements. No wonder it has more IPT centres than any other place in Chennai. Students, should however choose the best center among these. Uniq Technologies, will be your ultimate choice.provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life. </p>

            <p>Some occupations are inherently hazardous, and require a minimum level of competence before the practitioners can perform the work at an acceptable level of safety to themselves or others in the vicinity. <br>

          <div class="#"><p>We provide the ideas of reality in web site development by our excellent training. First, we start with the basics of Html, CSS, javascript,jquery,PHP and its framework and the development of web site were taught in Dreamweaver. The image editing process were also taught for the students by with Photoshop. The creation of animated clips were thought for the students with Flash. At the end of the every session practical trainings are provided for the students. We also guide the students in developing and hosting their own web site. </p></div>

                Simulation based training is another method which uses technology to assist in trainee development. This is particularly common in the training of skills requiring a very high degree of practice, and in those which include a significant responsibility for life and property. An advantage is that simulation training allows the trainer to find, study, and remedy skill deficiencies in their trainees in a controlled, virtual environment. This also allows the trainees an opportunity to experience and study events that would otherwise be rare on the job, e.g., in-flight emergencies, system failure, etc., wherein the trainer can run 'scenarios' and study how the trainee reacts, thus assisting in improving his/her skills if the event was to occur in the real world. Examples of skills that commonly include simulator training during stages of development include piloting aircraft, spacecraft, locomotives, and ships, operating air traffic control airspace/sectors, power plant operations training, advanced military/defense system training, and advanced emergency response training like fire training or first-aid training.

            <h4>Religion and spirituality</h4>
            <p>
              In religious and spiritual use, the word "training" may refer to the purification of the mind, heart, understanding and actions to obtain a variety of spiritual goals such as (for example) closeness to God or freedom from suffering.

            <p><strong></strong>  Researchers have developed training methods for artificial-intelligence devices as well. Evolutionary algorithms, including genetic programming and other methods of machine learning, use a system of feedback based on "fitness functions" to allow computer programs to determine how well an entity performs a task. The methods construct a series of programs, known as a “population” of programs, and then automatically test them for "fitness", observing how well they perform the intended task. The system automatically generates new programs based on members of the population that perform the best. These new members replace programs that perform the worst.
